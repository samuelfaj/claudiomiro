Fully implemented: YES

## Implementation Plan

- [X] **Create State class test file with initialization and singleton tests**
  - Files: `src/__tests__/config/state.test.js`
  - Tests: Constructor behavior, singleton instance, initial state (null folder paths)

- [X] **Test setFolder() method with path resolution**
  - Files: `src/__tests__/config/state.test.js`
  - Tests: Absolute path resolution, claudiomiro folder path construction, path.resolve and path.join behavior

- [X] **Test folder getter with various scenarios**
  - Files: `src/__tests__/config/state.test.js`
  - Tests: Get folder before setFolder (null), get folder after setFolder, folder immutability

- [X] **Test claudiomiroFolder getter with various scenarios**
  - Files: `src/__tests__/config/state.test.js`
  - Tests: Get claudiomiroFolder before setFolder (null), get claudiomiroFolder after setFolder, correct path joining

- [X] **Test edge cases and error scenarios**
  - Files: `src/__tests__/config/state.test.js`
  - Tests: Relative paths, special characters in paths, multiple setFolder calls, cross-platform path handling

## Verification
- [X] All tests pass (20/20 tests passing)
- [X] Code builds without errors (no build script, but tests run successfully)
- [X] Test coverage > 80% (100% coverage achieved for state.js)
