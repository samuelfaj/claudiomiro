## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/config/state.js State class.
Done when: state.test.js created, State class tested, persistence tested, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK7-17
- Complexity: Medium

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock file system operations
- Test state persistence and retrieval

## RISKS
1. File system state persistence → Mock fs.writeFileSync and fs.readFileSync
2. Path resolution → Mock path.join for predictable paths
