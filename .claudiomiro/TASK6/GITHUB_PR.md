# Task 6: State Class Test Coverage

Added comprehensive test coverage for the State configuration class with 20 unit tests achieving 100% code coverage. The test suite validates singleton pattern implementation, path resolution behavior for both `setFolder()` method and getter properties (`folder` and `claudiomiroFolder`), and handles edge cases including relative paths, special characters, cross-platform path separators, and multiple setter calls. All tests pass successfully ensuring the State class correctly manages project folder paths and constructs the `.claudiomiro` configuration directory path.
