# Task: Unit Tests for src/utils/validation.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for validation utility functions, specifically isFullyImplemented function with various TODO.md format scenarios.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/utils/validation.test.js (unit tests for validation.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Mock fs.readFileSync for different file content scenarios
2. Test isFullyImplemented returns true for "Fully implemented: yes"
3. Test isFullyImplemented returns false for "Fully implemented: no"
4. Test case-insensitive matching (YES, Yes, yes)
5. Test false positives: task items with "fully implemented: yes"
6. Test position detection (only first 10 lines)
7. Test edge cases: empty files, malformed content, missing markers
8. Test whitespace handling and trimming

## Done When
- [ ] isFullyImplemented tested with all scenarios
- [ ] True/false cases verified
- [ ] Task item filtering tested (lines starting with -)
- [ ] First 10 lines limit verified
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for validation.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/utils/validation.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for validation.js
