# Task: Unit Tests for src/config/state.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/config/state.js covering the State class and all its methods for managing application state.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1, TASK2
- **Blocks:** NONE
- **Parallel with:** TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/config/state.test.js

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Create __tests__/config/ directory
2. Create state.test.js
3. Mock fs and path modules
4. Test State class instantiation
5. Test state persistence methods (save/load)
6. Test state getters and setters
7. Test default state values
8. Test file path resolution
9. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`

## Done When
- [ ] __tests__/config/state.test.js exists
- [ ] State class constructor is tested
- [ ] State persistence (save/load) is tested
- [ ] All getters/setters are covered
- [ ] File system operations are properly mocked
- [ ] All tests pass when running `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage is > 80% for src/config/state.js

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- state.test.js
```
â†’ Expected: All tests pass, coverage > 80%
