# PR: Unit Tests for src/steps/step1.js

Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `src/steps/step1.js` with 27 test cases achieving 100% code coverage. The test suite covers all execution flows including task discovery and sorting, file content reading, prompt generation for both auto and hard modes, single task dependency handling, error scenarios, logger interactions, and path operations. All mocks are properly configured for fs, executeClaude, logger, and state modules, ensuring isolated and reliable testing of step1 functionality.
