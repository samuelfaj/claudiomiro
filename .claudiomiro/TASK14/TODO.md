Fully implemented: YES

## Implementation Plan

- [X] **Create test infrastructure and mock setup for step1**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step1.test.js`
  - Tests: Mock fs, path, executeClaude, logger, state; verify all mocks configured correctly

- [X] **Test basic execution flow and edge cases**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step1.test.js`
  - Tests: No tasks found, single task handling, task folder detection and sorting

- [X] **Test task content reading and processing**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step1.test.js`
  - Tests: Read TASK.md and PROMPT.md files, verify content aggregation, handle missing files

- [X] **Test prompt generation for both modes**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step1.test.js`
  - Tests: Auto mode prompt generation, hard mode prompt generation, verify executeClaude called with correct prompts

- [X] **Test dependency addition for single task**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step1.test.js`
  - Tests: Empty dependencies added to single task, verify file write operations, skip if @dependencies exists

- [X] **Test error handling and file operations**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step1.test.js`
  - Tests: Handle file read errors, executeClaude failures, fs operation failures

## Verification
- [X] All tests pass (27 tests passing)
- [X] Code builds without errors (syntax verified)
- [X] Coverage > 80% (100% coverage achieved)
