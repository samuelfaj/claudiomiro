# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step1.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for step1 (dependency analysis), including @dependencies tag addition, task file parsing, and dependency validation.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step1.test.js (unit tests for step1.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Import and mock dependencies (fs, executeClaude, logger, state)
2. Test step1 function execution flow
3. Test TASK.md file reading and parsing
4. Test Claude execution for dependency analysis
5. Test @dependencies tag addition to PROMPT.md
6. Test dependency validation and conflict detection
7. Test state updates with dependency information
8. Verify error handling and edge cases

## Done When
- [ ] All step1 functions are tested
- [ ] File parsing is covered
- [ ] Claude execution is mocked
- [ ] Dependency tag addition verified
- [ ] Validation is tested
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for step1.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/steps/step1.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for src/steps/step1.js
