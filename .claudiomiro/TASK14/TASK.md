# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step1.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/steps/step1.js covering step1 execution logic and operations.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1, TASK2
- **Blocks:** NONE
- **Parallel with:** TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step1.test.js

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Create step1.test.js
2. Mock all dependencies (executeClaude, logger, state, fs)
3. Test step1 execution flow
4. Test task file processing
5. Test prompt generation
6. Test error handling
7. Test state updates
8. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`

## Done When
- [ ] __tests__/steps/step1.test.js exists
- [ ] Step1 execution is tested
- [ ] Task processing is tested
- [ ] Prompt handling is verified
- [ ] Error scenarios are covered
- [ ] State management is tested
- [ ] All tests pass when running `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage is > 80% for src/steps/step1.js

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- step1.test.js
```
â†’ Expected: All tests pass, coverage > 80%
