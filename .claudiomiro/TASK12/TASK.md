# Task: Unit Tests for src/services/dag-executor.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/services/dag-executor.js covering the DAGExecutor class, task graph execution, and dependency management.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1, TASK2
- **Blocks:** NONE
- **Parallel with:** TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/services/dag-executor.test.js

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Create dag-executor.test.js
2. Mock fs, path, logger, state, isFullyImplemented, and step modules
3. Test DAGExecutor class instantiation
4. Test executeTasksInParallel() with independent tasks
5. Test topological sorting of dependencies
6. Test task execution with dependencies
7. Test error handling for failed tasks
8. Test task completion validation
9. Test parallel execution limits
10. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`

## Done When
- [ ] __tests__/services/dag-executor.test.js exists
- [ ] DAGExecutor instantiation is tested
- [ ] Parallel execution is tested
- [ ] Dependency resolution is tested
- [ ] Error handling is tested
- [ ] Task validation is tested
- [ ] All tests pass when running `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage is > 80% for src/services/dag-executor.js

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- dag-executor.test.js
```
â†’ Expected: All tests pass, coverage > 80%
