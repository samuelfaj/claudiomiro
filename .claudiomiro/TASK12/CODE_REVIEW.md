# Code Review

## Status
✅ APPROVED

## Summary
Requirements met, no critical issues found.

## Checks
- ✅ Requirements match scope
- ✅ No critical bugs detected
- ✅ Tests cover acceptance criteria

## Details

### Test Coverage
- **98.23%** statement coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **95.65%** branch coverage
- **94.44%** function coverage
- **99.09%** line coverage
- All 55 tests passing

### Requirements Verification

✅ **dag-executor.test.js created** - File exists at `src/services/__tests__/dag-executor.test.js`

✅ **Parallel execution tested** - Tests verify:
- `executeWave()` respects maxConcurrent limit
- Independent tasks execute concurrently
- Promise.allSettled handling
- Running set management

✅ **Dependency handling verified** - Tests cover:
- Simple dependency chains
- Complex graphs (diamond pattern, long chains)
- Circular prevention
- Missing dependencies
- Completed/pending/failed status filtering

✅ **Tests pass** - All 55 tests passing in 0.383s

✅ **Coverage > 80%** - Achieved 98.23% statement coverage

### Test Quality
- Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies (fs, logger, steps, validation)
- Edge cases covered (empty tasks, single task, all independent, long chains)
- Integration scenarios tested (full DAG execution with various patterns)
- Error handling verified (max attempts, task failures, cleanup)
- Status transitions tested (pending→running→completed/failed)

### Implementation Alignment
All items from TODO.md are properly implemented:
1. Constructor tests ✓
2. Dependency resolution tests ✓
3. Step filtering logic ✓
4. Parallel execution mechanics ✓
5. Single task execution flow ✓
6. Status transitions and error handling ✓
7. Complete DAG execution scenarios ✓
8. Edge cases and integration scenarios ✓
