# DAG Executor Comprehensive Test Suite

This PR adds comprehensive test coverage for the DAG Executor service, achieving 98.23% code coverage across 55 test cases. The test suite validates all critical functionality including constructor initialization with CPU-based concurrency calculations, dependency resolution and ready task detection across simple and complex dependency graphs, step filtering logic with allowedSteps arrays, parallel execution wave mechanics respecting maxConcurrent limits, complete task lifecycle execution from step2 through step4 with proper status transitions, error handling with max retry attempts, and edge cases including empty task lists, diamond dependency patterns, and partial completions. All tests use proper mocking to isolate external dependencies (fs, steps, validation) ensuring reliable and fast test execution.
