## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/services/dag-executor.js DAGExecutor class.
Done when: dag-executor.test.js created, parallel execution tested, dependency handling verified, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK13-17
- Complexity: High

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock all step execution functions
- Test topological sorting

## RISKS
1. Async parallel execution → Use Promise.all mocking and jest.fn() for timing
2. Dependency graph complexity → Start with simple graphs, add complexity
3. Task state management → Mock isFullyImplemented for different scenarios
