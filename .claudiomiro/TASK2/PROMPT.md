## OBJECTIVE
Create shared test utilities and mocks for consistent testing.
Done when: test-utils.js created, logger/fs/state mocks created, all utilities documented, modules load without errors.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1
- Provides for: TASK3-17

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 1 (Test Infrastructure)
- Parallel with: NONE
- Complexity: Low

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Utilities should be simple and reusable

## RISKS
1. Over-engineering utilities → Keep utilities simple and focused
2. Mock inconsistency with real modules → Base mocks on actual module interfaces
