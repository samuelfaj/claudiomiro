# TASK2: Test Utilities and Mocks

Created comprehensive test infrastructure including shared test utilities (`test-utils.js`) with setup/cleanup helpers and console mocking, and mock modules for logger, filesystem, and state management. All utilities are fully tested with 112 passing tests across unit and integration test suites, providing a solid foundation for testing all other modules in the codebase.
