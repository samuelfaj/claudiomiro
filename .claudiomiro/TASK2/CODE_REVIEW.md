# Code Review

## Status
✅ APPROVED

## Summary
Requirements met, no critical issues found.

## Checks
- ✅ Requirements match scope
- ✅ No critical bugs detected
- ✅ Tests cover acceptance criteria

## Detailed Review

### Requirements Coverage
All requirements from PROMPT.md are fully implemented:

1. **test-utils.js created** ✅
   - `setupTestEnvironment()` - sets up mocked console methods
   - `cleanupTestEnvironment()` - restores mocks
   - `mockConsole()` / `restoreConsole()` - console mocking utilities
   - `createMockLogger()` - creates fully mocked logger
   - `assertThrows()` / `assertDoesNotThrow()` - assertion helpers

2. **Logger mock created** ✅
   - Location: `src/__tests__/__mocks__/logger.js`
   - All logger methods mocked (info, success, error, warning, spinner, indent/outdent, etc.)
   - Tests: `src/__tests__/mocks/logger.test.js` (32 passing tests)

3. **Filesystem mock created** ✅
   - Location: `src/__tests__/__mocks__/fs-utils.js`
   - In-memory filesystem with full async/sync API
   - Supports: readFile, writeFile, exists, mkdir, rm, readdir, stat
   - Tests: `src/__tests__/mocks/fs.test.js` (42 passing tests)

4. **State mock created** ✅
   - Location: `src/__tests__/__mocks__/state.js`
   - Matches original state.js interface (setFolder, folder, claudiomiroFolder)
   - Tests: `src/__tests__/mocks/state.test.js` (18 passing tests)

5. **Documentation created** ✅
   - Comprehensive README.md with usage examples
   - All utilities documented with code snippets
   - Best practices and integration test examples included

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully:
- **Test Suites**: 5 passed, 5 total
- **Tests**: 112 passed, 112 total
- **Coverage**: All utilities have dedicated tests

### Code Quality
- ✅ Clean, readable code with proper JSDoc comments
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Error handling matches Node.js fs module behavior
- ✅ Proper module exports
- ✅ No dependencies beyond jest (test environment)

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ test-utils.js created with documented utilities
- ✅ logger/fs/state mocks created and tested
- ✅ All utilities documented with examples
- ✅ Modules load without errors (in Jest environment)
- ✅ All tests pass (`npm test`)

### Notes
- Mock modules correctly use `jest.fn()` and only work within Jest test environment (expected behavior)
- Filesystem mock uses in-memory storage, preventing accidental file system access during tests
- State mock properly tracks method calls using `jest.spyOn()`
- Test utilities are simple, focused, and reusable as required

## Conclusion
Implementation is complete, well-tested, and ready for use by dependent tasks (TASK3-17).
