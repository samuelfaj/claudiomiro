# Task: Unit Tests for src/config/state.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for the State class including folder path management, claudiomiro folder resolution, and singleton behavior.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/config/state.test.js (unit tests for state.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Test State class instantiation and singleton pattern
2. Test setFolder with absolute and relative paths
3. Test folder getter returns resolved absolute path
4. Test claudiomiroFolder getter returns correct .claudiomiro path
5. Test path resolution with path.resolve behavior
6. Test state initialization (null values before setFolder)
7. Test multiple setFolder calls (state updates correctly)
8. Test edge cases: empty strings, special characters in paths

## Done When
- [ ] State class fully tested
- [ ] Singleton behavior verified
- [ ] Path resolution logic tested
- [ ] Getters tested for both properties
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for state.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/config/state.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for state.js
