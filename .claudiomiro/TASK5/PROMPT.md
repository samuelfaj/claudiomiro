## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/cli.js module.
Done when: cli.test.js created, all CLI functions tested, error handling covered, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK3, TASK4, TASK6-17
- Complexity: High

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test async operations properly

## RISKS
1. Complex dependency mocking → Use jest.mock() for module-level mocks
2. File system operations → Mock fs module completely
3. User input prompts → Mock inquirer/prompts library
