## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for logger.js module.
Done when: logger.test.js created, all methods tested, edge cases covered, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK4-17
- Complexity: Medium

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock console methods to test output
- Test all logger methods including spinners

## RISKS
1. Console mocking complexity → Use jest.spyOn for console methods
2. Spinner timing issues → Mock ora library for deterministic tests
