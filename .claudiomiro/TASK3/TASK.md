# Task: Unit Tests for logger.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for the Logger class covering all logging methods, spinner functionality, indentation, progress bars, and formatting.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/logger.test.js (unit tests for logger.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Mock external dependencies (chalk, ora, log-symbols, boxen, gradient-string)
2. Test all logging methods (info, success, warning, error)
3. Test spinner lifecycle (start, update, succeed, fail, stop)
4. Test indentation system (indent, outdent, resetIndent)
5. Test formatting methods (banner, box, separator, progress bar)
6. Test utility methods (path, command, task, subtask)
7. Verify chalk color usage and console output
8. Test edge cases: multiple spinners, negative indent

## Done When
- [ ] All Logger methods are tested
- [ ] Spinner state management verified
- [ ] Console output mocked and verified
- [ ] Indentation logic tested
- [ ] Progress bar calculation tested
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for logger.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/logger.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for logger.js
