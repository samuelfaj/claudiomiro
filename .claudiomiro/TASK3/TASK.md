@dependencies [TASK1]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK1 (ParallelStateManager)
- **Reasoning:**
  - **Import Dependency:** Imports and uses `ParallelStateManager` class from `src/services/parallel-state-manager.js` (created by TASK1)
  - **Cannot parallelize with TASK1:** Needs the class definition to exist before integration
  - **Logical dependency:** Calls methods `initialize()`, `updateTaskStatus()`, `updateTaskStep()` which must be implemented first
- **Assumptions:**
  - `src/services/dag-executor.js` exists with clear lifecycle hooks
  - DAG executor has constructor, executeTask(), and clear success/failure paths
  - ParallelStateManager API from TASK1 is stable and matches expectations
  - State updates won't break existing DAG executor flow
- **Blocks:** TASK7 (which modifies the same `dag-executor.js` file)
- **Parallel with:** TASK4 (different files), TASK5 (different files), TASK6 (different files)
- **Risks:**
  - **File conflict with TASK7:** Both modify `dag-executor.js` → TASK7 must run after TASK3
  - ParallelStateManager API mismatch could break integration
  - State updates might impact performance (mitigated by synchronous updates)
  - Exception handling must not skip state updates
- **Files Created:** None
- **Files Modified:** `src/services/dag-executor.js`, `src/services/__tests__/dag-executor.test.js`
- **File Conflicts:** TASK7 also modifies `dag-executor.js` (TASK7 depends on TASK3)
- **Parallelization Opportunity:** Can run simultaneously with TASK4, TASK5, TASK6 (Wave 2, after TASK1)

# Task: Integrate State Tracking with DAG Executor

## Objective
Integrate the ParallelStateManager into the DAG executor to track task status changes throughout the execution lifecycle. This enables real-time state updates as tasks transition through pending→running→completed/failed states.

## Assumptions
- ParallelStateManager is already implemented (TASK1 completed)
- DAG executor already has clear lifecycle points: initialization, task start, task completion, task failure
- State updates should happen at critical points: wave execution start, task execution start, task completion
- Step information comes from existing log messages (e.g., "Step 3 - Implementation")
- No performance impact from state updates (they're synchronous and lightweight)
- State manager is singleton, safe to import and use directly

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (ParallelStateManager must exist)
- **Blocks:** TASK7
- **Parallel with:** TASK4, TASK5, TASK6

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- None

**MODIFY:**
- src/services/dag-executor.js (add state manager integration)
- src/services/__tests__/dag-executor.test.js (update tests to verify state tracking)

## Steps to Implement
1. Import ParallelStateManager in dag-executor.js
2. Initialize state manager in constructor with tasks object
3. Update task status to 'running' when executeTask() starts
4. Update task status to 'completed' when task completes successfully
5. Update task status to 'failed' when task fails
6. Extract and update step information from log messages (e.g., "Step 2", "Step 3.1")
7. Ensure state is updated before each major operation
8. Add getter method to expose state manager for external access
9. Update existing unit tests to verify state transitions
10. Add new tests for state manager integration

## Research Summary
- **Integration points in DAG executor:**
  - Constructor: Initialize state
  - executeTask() start: Set running status
  - executeTask() completion: Set completed/failed status
  - Step execution: Update current step
- **Step extraction pattern:** Parse logger messages containing "Step X" or "Step X.Y"
- **Testing approach:** Mock ParallelStateManager and verify method calls
- **Edge cases:**
  - Task fails before running (should still update state)
  - Multiple tasks complete simultaneously (state manager handles this)

## Acceptance Criteria (Rigorous)
- [ ] ParallelStateManager imported and instantiated in DAG executor constructor
- [ ] State manager initialized with tasks object from constructor
- [ ] Task status updated to 'running' when executeTask() begins
- [ ] Task status updated to 'completed' when task succeeds
- [ ] Task status updated to 'failed' when task fails with error
- [ ] Step information extracted from log messages and updated in state
- [ ] Getter method `getStateManager()` returns state manager instance
- [ ] Existing unit tests updated to account for state manager
- [ ] New tests verify state transitions for all scenarios
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test -- dag-executor.test.js`
- [ ] No performance degradation (state updates are fast)

## Self-Verification Logic
Before marking this task as completed:
1. Run `npm test -- dag-executor.test.js` → all tests pass
2. Verify state updates happen at correct lifecycle points via code review
3. Check all acceptance criteria met
4. If any criterion fails → mark as "RETRY REQUIRED" and fix
5. If all pass → mark as "SUCCESS"

## Reasoning Trace
**Why this approach?**
- DAG executor already has clear lifecycle hooks, perfect for state updates
- Extracting step info from existing log messages avoids duplicate logic
- Synchronous state updates don't block async task execution
- Getter method allows UI renderer to access state without tight coupling

**What alternatives were rejected?**
- Event emitters: More complex, unnecessary indirection
- Passing state manager to each step: Couples step implementation with state
- Polling state from outside: Less efficient than push updates

**What risks exist?**
- State updates might be missed if exceptions occur (mitigated by try/catch)
- Step extraction regex could fail on unexpected formats (gracefully degrade to no step info)
- Performance impact if called too frequently (mitigated by calling only at lifecycle points)

## Escalation Protocol
If blocked or encountering undefined behavior:
1. Stop execution
2. Save state in /Users/samuelfajreldines/Desenvolvimento/claudiomiro copy/.claudiomiro/BLOCKED.md
3. Add entry: reason, attempted fix, next suggestion

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- dag-executor.test.js
```
→ Expected output: All tests pass, state transitions verified
