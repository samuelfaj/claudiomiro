# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step3.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for step3 (implementation), including TODO.md processing, Claude execution for code implementation, and completion verification.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step3.test.js (unit tests for step3.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Import and mock dependencies (fs, executeClaude, logger, state, prompt-reader)
2. Test step3 function execution flow
3. Test TODO.md reading and parsing
4. Test Claude execution for implementation
5. Test completion verification (TODO.md first line check)
6. Test user feedback integration
7. Test state updates for implementation status
8. Verify error handling and edge cases

## Done When
- [ ] All step3 functions are tested
- [ ] TODO.md processing is covered
- [ ] Claude execution is mocked
- [ ] Completion check verified
- [ ] User feedback handled
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for step3.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/steps/step3.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for src/steps/step3.js
