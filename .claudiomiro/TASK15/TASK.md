# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step2.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/steps/step2.js covering step2 execution logic and operations.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1, TASK2
- **Blocks:** NONE
- **Parallel with:** TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK16, TASK17

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step2.test.js

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Create step2.test.js
2. Mock all dependencies (executeClaude, logger, state, fs)
3. Test step2 execution flow
4. Test task implementation logic
5. Test prompt handling
6. Test error handling
7. Test state updates
8. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`

## Done When
- [ ] __tests__/steps/step2.test.js exists
- [ ] Step2 execution is tested
- [ ] Implementation logic is tested
- [ ] Prompt handling is verified
- [ ] Error scenarios are covered
- [ ] State management is tested
- [ ] All tests pass when running `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage is > 80% for src/steps/step2.js

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- step2.test.js
```
â†’ Expected: All tests pass, coverage > 80%
