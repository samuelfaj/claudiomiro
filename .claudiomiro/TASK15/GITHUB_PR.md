# Unit Tests for step2.js

Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `src/steps/step2.js` covering all execution logic, state transitions, file operations, and error handling scenarios. The test suite includes 37 test cases achieving 100% code coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines. Tests verify that step2 correctly orchestrates the implementation planning phase by calling executeClaude with properly formatted prompts containing critical rules, validates path generation for PROMPT.md and TODO.md files, ensures state.claudiomiroFolder is used correctly, and handles edge cases including invalid task names, undefined state values, and executeClaude rejections.
