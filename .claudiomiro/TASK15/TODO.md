Fully implemented: YES

## Implementation Plan

- [X] **Create test file structure and basic setup**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step2.test.js`
  - Tests: Test suite setup with proper mocks for fs, path, state, and executeClaude

- [X] **Test step2 function execution flow**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step2.test.js`
  - Tests: Verify executeClaude is called with correct prompt, test folder path generation, validate prompt includes all critical rules

- [X] **Test state transitions and file operations**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step2.test.js`
  - Tests: Verify state.claudiomiroFolder usage, test path.join operations, validate PROMPT.md read and TODO.md creation paths

- [X] **Test error handling and edge cases**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step2.test.js`
  - Tests: Test with invalid task names, test executeClaude promise rejection, verify error propagation

- [X] **Verify test coverage and implementation**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step2.test.js`
  - Tests: Run jest with coverage, ensure >80% coverage for step2.js, verify all execution paths tested

## Verification
- [X] All tests pass
- [X] Code builds without errors
- [X] Feature works as expected
