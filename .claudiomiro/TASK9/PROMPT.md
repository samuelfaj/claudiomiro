## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/services/claude-executor.js module.
Done when: claude-executor.test.js created, API execution tested, error handling covered, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK10-17
- Complexity: High

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock child_process spawn
- Mock all file operations

## RISKS
1. spawn process mocking → Use jest.mock('child_process') with EventEmitter
2. Async stream processing → Use async/await with proper event handling
3. File I/O operations → Mock all fs methods
