Fully implemented: YES

## Implementation Plan

- [X] **Setup test infrastructure and mocks**
  - Files: `src/services/__tests__/claude-executor.test.js`, `src/__tests__/mocks/child_process.js`
  - Tests: Mock setup validation, EventEmitter integration
  - Create child_process mock with spawn returning EventEmitter
  - Mock fs (writeFileSync, createWriteStream, existsSync, unlinkSync)
  - Mock logger, state, claude-logger modules

- [X] **Test executeClaude success flow**
  - Files: `src/services/__tests__/claude-executor.test.js`
  - Tests: Successful execution (code 0), promise resolution, temp file creation/cleanup
  - Verify spawn called with correct arguments (sh, -c, command)
  - Verify tmp file created and cleaned up
  - Verify logger methods called (stopSpinner, command, separator, success)

- [X] **Test stdout streaming and message processing**
  - Files: `src/services/__tests__/claude-executor.test.js`
  - Tests: JSON stream parsing, processClaudeMessage calls, buffer handling, log file writing
  - Simulate stdout data events with partial/complete JSON lines
  - Verify processClaudeMessage called for each complete line
  - Verify console output for Claude messages
  - Verify log file written with timestamps

- [X] **Test error handling scenarios**
  - Files: `src/services/__tests__/claude-executor.test.js`
  - Tests: Non-zero exit codes, spawn errors, temp file cleanup on error
  - Test exit code !== 0 rejects promise with correct error
  - Test spawn 'error' event rejects promise
  - Verify temp file cleanup on both error scenarios
  - Verify error logging and log file writing

- [X] **Test edge cases and integration**
  - Files: `src/services/__tests__/claude-executor.test.js`
  - Tests: stderr handling, incomplete buffer lines, overwriteBlock logic, long text wrapping
  - Test stderr data logged to file with [STDERR] prefix
  - Test buffer with incomplete lines maintained correctly
  - Test overwriteBlock ANSI escape sequences
  - Verify coverage > 80%

## Verification
- [X] All tests pass
- [X] Code builds without errors
- [X] Test coverage > 80% for claude-executor.js (achieved 98.86%)
