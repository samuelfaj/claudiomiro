# Task: Unit Tests for src/services/claude-executor.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/services/claude-executor.js covering Claude API execution, message processing, and error handling.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1, TASK2
- **Blocks:** NONE
- **Parallel with:** TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Create claude-executor.test.js
2. Mock spawn, fs, path, logger, state, processClaudeMessage
3. Test executeClaude() successful execution
4. Test executeClaude() with API errors
5. Test overwriteBlock() function
6. Test message streaming and processing
7. Test file writing operations
8. Test error handling and logging
9. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`

## Done When
- [ ] __tests__/services/claude-executor.test.js exists
- [ ] executeClaude() success path is tested
- [ ] executeClaude() error handling is tested
- [ ] overwriteBlock() is tested
- [ ] Message processing is verified
- [ ] File operations are mocked and tested
- [ ] All tests pass when running `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage is > 80% for src/services/claude-executor.js

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- claude-executor.test.js
```
