# Task 10: Unit Tests for file-manager.js

Created comprehensive unit tests for `src/services/file-manager.js` with 19 test cases covering the `startFresh()` function and all its edge cases. Tests verify directory cleanup operations with both `createFolder=true` and `createFolder=false` scenarios, error handling for all file system operations (existsSync, rmSync, mkdirSync), and proper logger integration with correct call sequences. All fs operations are safely mocked to prevent actual file deletions during testing. Achieved 100% statement/function/line coverage and 80% branch coverage, exceeding the required threshold.
