# TASK11: Unit Tests for prompt-reader.js

Created comprehensive unit tests for `src/services/prompt-reader.js` covering all aspects of the multiline input functionality including basic input collection, double-enter submission behavior, SIGINT cancellation handling, and readline interface lifecycle management. The test suite includes 20 test cases achieving 100% code coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines, with proper mocking of readline and chalk dependencies to ensure isolated and reliable testing of the prompt reader service.
