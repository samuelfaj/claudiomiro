# Task: Unit Tests for src/services/dag-executor.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for the DAG executor service, including task dependency resolution, wave execution, parallel task processing, and error handling.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/services/dag-executor.test.js (unit tests for dag-executor.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Import and mock dependencies (fs, logger, state, steps, validation)
2. Test DAGExecutor class instantiation
3. Test getReadyTasks with various dependency states
4. Test executeWave with parallel task execution
5. Test executeTask with step routing (step2, step3, step4, codeReview)
6. Test dependency resolution and blocking
7. Test error handling in wave execution
8. Verify task state transitions and logging

## Done When
- [ ] All DAGExecutor methods are tested
- [ ] Dependency resolution is covered
- [ ] Parallel wave execution is tested
- [ ] Step routing is verified
- [ ] Error scenarios are tested
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for dag-executor.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/services/dag-executor.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for src/services/dag-executor.js
