## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/services/dag-executor.js (task dependency and parallel execution).
Done when: DAGExecutor tested, getReadyTasks verified, executeWave covered, dependency resolution tested, >90% coverage, runs independently.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1 (Jest setup)
- Provides for: TASK20 (Integration tests)

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 1 (Unit Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK2-7, TASK9-19 (17 other unit test tasks)
- Complexity: High

## CONSTRAINTS
- Mock all external dependencies (fs, logger, state, step functions, validation)
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- Test complex dependency graphs
- Verify parallel execution behavior
- Test error propagation and recovery
- No manual/deployment steps

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Create __tests__/services/dag-executor.test.js
2. Mock fs (readFileSync for TASK.md parsing)
3. Mock logger (info, error, warn)
4. Mock state (setTaskState, getTaskState, getAllTaskStates)
5. Mock step modules (step2, step3, step4, codeReview)
6. Mock validation (validateTaskStructure)
7. Test cases:
   - DAGExecutor initialization with task list
   - getReadyTasks: returns tasks with satisfied dependencies
   - getReadyTasks: blocks tasks with pending dependencies
   - executeWave: runs multiple tasks in parallel (Promise.all)
   - executeTask: routes to correct step function based on task
   - executeTask: handles errors and sets task to failed
   - Full DAG execution: multi-wave scenario
   - Edge cases: circular dependencies, missing dependencies
8. Use jest.fn() for step functions returning Promises
9. Verify Promise.all called for parallel execution

## RISKS
1. DAG complexity → Start with simple linear dependencies
2. Parallel execution testing → Use mock timers or resolved promises
3. State management → Carefully track mock state changes across waves
