# TASK7: Unit Tests for src/utils/validation.js

Created comprehensive unit tests for `src/utils/validation.js` with 36 test cases covering the `isFullyImplemented` function across multiple scenarios including basic detection (exact match, case variations, spacing), task list filtering, first 10 lines limitation, edge cases (empty files, non-existent files, permission errors, special characters, Unicode, emoji), malformed content handling, and multi-line formatting variations. All tests pass successfully with 100% statement coverage, 100% function coverage, 100% line coverage, and 83.33% branch coverage, exceeding the required 80% threshold.
