# Task: Unit Tests for src/services/claude-executor.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for the Claude executor service, including process spawning, temp file handling, stdout/stderr processing, and logging.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/services/claude-executor.test.js (unit tests for claude-executor.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Import and mock dependencies (fs, child_process.spawn, logger, state)
2. Test executeClaude function with valid inputs
3. Test spawn process creation and configuration
4. Test temp file creation and cleanup
5. Test stdout/stderr data processing and logging
6. Test process exit handling (success and error codes)
7. Test error scenarios: spawn failure, file write errors, timeout
8. Verify state updates and logger calls

## Done When
- [ ] All executeClaude functions are tested
- [ ] Process spawning is mocked and verified
- [ ] Temp file operations are tested
- [ ] stdout/stderr handling is covered
- [ ] Error scenarios are tested
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for claude-executor.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/services/claude-executor.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for src/services/claude-executor.js
