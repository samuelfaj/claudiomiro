## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/services/claude-executor.js (Claude process execution).
Done when: executeClaude tested, spawn mocked, temp files handled, stdout/stderr processed, >90% coverage, runs independently.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1 (Jest setup)
- Provides for: TASK20 (Integration tests)

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 1 (Unit Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK2-6, TASK8-19 (17 other unit test tasks)
- Complexity: Medium

## CONSTRAINTS
- Mock all external dependencies (fs, child_process.spawn, logger, state)
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- Test async process execution and event handling
- Verify temp file creation and cleanup
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- No manual/deployment steps

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1. Create __tests__/services/claude-executor.test.js
2. Mock child_process.spawn with EventEmitter for stdout/stderr/exit events
3. Mock fs (writeFileSync, unlinkSync, mkdtempSync)
4. Mock logger (info, error, debug)
5. Mock state (getCurrentTask, setTaskState)
6. Test cases:
   - Successful execution: spawn → stdout data → exit(0) → resolve
   - Error handling: spawn error, non-zero exit code
   - Temp file creation: verify writeFileSync called with correct content
   - Temp file cleanup: verify unlinkSync called
   - stdout/stderr processing: verify logger calls
   - State updates: verify state methods called
7. Use jest.fn() for event handlers (on, once)
8. Test processClaudeMessage integration

## RISKS
1. EventEmitter complexity → Use simple mock implementations
2. Async/event timing → Use setImmediate or nextTick in tests
3. Temp file paths → Mock mkdtempSync to return predictable paths
