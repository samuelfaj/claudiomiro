## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/utils/validation.js module.
Done when: validation.test.js created, isFullyImplemented tested, edge cases covered, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK8-17
- Complexity: Low

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock file system reads
- Test both success and failure paths

## RISKS
1. File system operations → Mock fs.readFileSync and fs.existsSync
2. Path handling → Test with various path formats
