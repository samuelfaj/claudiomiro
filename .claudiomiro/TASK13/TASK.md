# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step0.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/steps/step0.js covering the initial step execution and task planning logic.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1, TASK2
- **Blocks:** NONE
- **Parallel with:** TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step0.test.js

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Create __tests__/steps/ directory
2. Create step0.test.js
3. Mock all dependencies (executeClaude, logger, state, fs)
4. Test step0 execution flow
5. Test prompt reading and processing
6. Test file creation operations
7. Test error handling
8. Test state updates
9. Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`

## Done When
- [ ] __tests__/steps/step0.test.js exists
- [ ] Step0 execution is tested
- [ ] Prompt processing is tested
- [ ] File operations are verified
- [ ] Error handling is tested
- [ ] State management is tested
- [ ] All tests pass when running `npm test`
- [ ] Test coverage is > 80% for src/steps/step0.js

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- step0.test.js
```
â†’ Expected: All tests pass, coverage > 80%
