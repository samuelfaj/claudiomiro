# TASK1: Setup Jest Configuration and GitHub Actions

This task establishes the testing foundation for the project by installing and configuring Jest as the testing framework, creating a comprehensive Jest configuration with coverage reporting, implementing a sample test suite for the logger module with 23 passing tests, and setting up a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x) for every push and pull request to ensure continuous quality validation across the codebase.
