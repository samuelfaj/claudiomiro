# Task: Setup Jest Configuration and GitHub Actions

## Objective
Configure Jest testing framework for the project and setup GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests on every push and pull request.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** NONE
- **Blocks:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17
- **Parallel with:** NONE

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- jest.config.js
- .github/workflows/test.yml

**MODIFY:**
- package.json (add jest dependency and test script)

## Steps
1. Install Jest as dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev jest`
2. Create jest.config.js with appropriate configuration for Node.js project
3. Update package.json test script to run jest
4. Create .github/workflows/test.yml for CI/CD automation
5. Configure GitHub Actions to run tests on push and pull requests
6. Test the configuration locally by running `npm test` (should show no tests found initially)

## Done When
- [ ] Jest is installed as dev dependency
- [ ] jest.config.js exists with proper configuration
- [ ] package.json has "test": "jest" script
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file exists at .github/workflows/test.yml
- [ ] Workflow runs on push and pull_request events
- [ ] Running `npm test` executes successfully (even with 0 tests)

## Verify
```bash
npm test
```
â†’ Expected: Jest runs successfully (may show "No tests found")
