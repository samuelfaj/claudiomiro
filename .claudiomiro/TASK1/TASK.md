# Task: Jest Setup and Configuration

## Objective
Configure Jest testing framework with comprehensive settings for unit, integration, and coverage testing across the entire claudiomiro project.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** NONE
- **Blocks:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK18, TASK19
- **Parallel with:** NONE (Foundation task)

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- jest.config.js (Jest configuration)
- __tests__/setup.js (Test setup/teardown utilities)
- __mocks__/fs.js (Mock file system)
- __mocks__/child_process.js (Mock spawn/exec)

**MODIFY:**
- package.json (add Jest dependencies and scripts)

## Steps
1. Install Jest and related dependencies (@types/jest, jest-environment-node, @jest/globals)
2. Create jest.config.js with comprehensive coverage and test settings
3. Configure test patterns, coverage thresholds (90%+), and reporters
4. Create test setup file with global mocks and utilities
5. Create mock files for Node.js core modules (fs, child_process, path)
6. Add npm scripts for test, test:watch, test:coverage, test:ci
7. Configure coverage reports (JSON, HTML, LCOV, text-summary)
8. Set up parallel test execution configuration

## Done When
- [ ] Jest is installed and configured
- [ ] package.json has all test scripts
- [ ] Coverage threshold set to 90%
- [ ] Mock files created for core dependencies
- [ ] Test setup file provides utility functions
- [ ] `npm test` runs successfully (even with no tests yet)
- [ ] Coverage report directory configured

## Verify
```bash
npm test -- --listTests
```
Expected: Shows test pattern configuration

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
Expected: Generates coverage report structure
