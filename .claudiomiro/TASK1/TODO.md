Fully implemented: YES

## Implementation Plan

- [X] **Install Jest and configure testing framework**
  - Files: `package.json`, `jest.config.js`
  - Tests: Run `npm test` to verify Jest is properly configured
  - Actions:
    - Add Jest and related dependencies (jest, @types/jest if needed)
    - Create comprehensive jest.config.js with Node.js preset
    - Configure coverage reporting (collectCoverage, coverageDirectory, coverageReporters)
    - Update package.json test script to run Jest
    - Set testEnvironment to 'node'

- [X] **Create initial test structure and sample tests**
  - Files: `src/__tests__/`, `src/logger.test.js`
  - Tests: Write basic tests for existing logger.js to validate setup
  - Actions:
    - Create __tests__ directory structure
    - Write sample test file for logger.js functionality
    - Ensure tests can import and test existing modules
    - Verify test discovery and execution works

- [X] **Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow**
  - Files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Tests: Workflow should trigger on push and pull_request events
  - Actions:
    - Create .github/workflows directory
    - Create ci.yml with Node.js setup (actions/checkout, actions/setup-node)
    - Configure workflow to run on push and pull_request
    - Add npm install and npm test steps
    - Include coverage reporting step

- [X] **Add test coverage configuration and scripts**
  - Files: `package.json`, `jest.config.js`, `.gitignore`
  - Tests: Run coverage report and verify output
  - Actions:
    - Add test:coverage script to package.json
    - Configure coverage thresholds in jest.config.js
    - Add coverage directory to .gitignore
    - Set collectCoverageFrom patterns for src/ files

- [X] **Document testing setup and validate end-to-end**
  - Files: `package.json`, all test files
  - Tests: Full validation that all components work together
  - Actions:
    - Run npm test and verify all tests pass
    - Run npm run test:coverage and verify coverage report
    - Validate jest.config.js settings work correctly
    - Ensure no configuration conflicts

## Verification
- [X] All tests pass with `npm test`
- [X] Coverage report generates successfully
- [X] GitHub Actions workflow file is valid
- [X] Jest configuration supports Node.js environment
