## OBJECTIVE
Setup Jest testing framework and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
Done when: Jest installed, jest.config.js created, package.json test script updated, GitHub Actions workflow created, npm test runs successfully.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: NONE
- Provides for: TASK2, TASK3-17

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 0 (Foundation)
- Parallel with: NONE
- Complexity: Low

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include comprehensive jest.config.js for Node.js
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- GitHub Actions must run on push and pull_request
- Support for coverage reporting

## RISKS
1. Jest configuration incompatible with Node.js version → Use standard Node.js preset
2. GitHub Actions permissions issues → Use standard actions/checkout and actions/setup-node
