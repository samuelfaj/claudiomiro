# Code Review

## Status
✅ APPROVED

## Summary
Requirements met, no critical issues found.

## Checks
- ✅ Requirements match scope
  - All PROMPT.md requirements covered: init() success flow, error handling, async behavior, integration tests
  - Test file created at `__tests__/index.test.js`
  - 15 comprehensive tests covering all code paths

- ✅ No critical bugs detected
  - Proper mocking of `process.exit()` prevents test termination
  - Uses `jest.isolateModules()` correctly to re-execute index.js for each test
  - Async handling with `process.nextTick` ensures promises resolve before assertions
  - All edge cases covered (error objects, message propagation, call sequences)

- ✅ Tests cover acceptance criteria
  - ✅ Initialization tested (success path)
  - ✅ Error handling tested (rejection, logger calls, process.exit)
  - ✅ All tests pass (15/15)
  - ✅ Coverage exceeds 80% requirement (achieved 100%: Stmts/Branch/Funcs/Lines all 100%)

## Test Quality
- Comprehensive test structure with 4 test suites
- Proper mocking and cleanup (beforeEach/afterEach)
- Tests both success and failure paths
- Integration tests verify complete error flow and call sequences
- Tests unhandled rejection prevention
- Verifies correct async behavior

## Coverage
