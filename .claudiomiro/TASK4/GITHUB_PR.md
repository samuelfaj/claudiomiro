# TASK4: Unit Tests for index.js

## Summary
Created comprehensive unit tests for `index.js` covering CLI initialization, error handling, and process exit scenarios. The test suite includes 15 test cases organized into four test suites: success flow validation, error handling verification, async behavior testing, and full integration error flow. Tests mock the logger and CLI initialization to verify correct behavior in both success and failure scenarios, including proper error logging and process exit handling. Achieved 100% test coverage (statements, branches, functions, and lines) exceeding the >80% requirement.

## Quality Gates
- ✅ All 15 tests passing
- ✅ 100% test coverage (Stmts: 100%, Branch: 100%, Funcs: 100%, Lines: 100%)
- ✅ JavaScript syntax validation passed
- ✅ No linting issues (project has no linting configuration)
