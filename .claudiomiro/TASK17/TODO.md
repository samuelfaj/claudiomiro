Fully implemented: YES

## Implementation Plan

- [X] **Create step4.test.js with test setup and basic structure**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step4.test.js`
  - Tests: Mock executeClaude, mock fs module, setup test fixtures with sample task names

- [X] **Test successful execution flow (all tests pass)**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step4.test.js`
  - Tests: Verify executeClaude called with correct prompt, verify GITHUB_PR.md creation mentioned in prompt, verify state.claudiomiroFolder usage

- [X] **Test failure handling and TODO.md refactoring**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step4.test.js`
  - Tests: Verify prompt includes instructions to delete CODE_REVIEW.md, verify prompt includes instructions to update TODO.md first line to "Fully implemented: NO"

- [X] **Test folder path construction and file references**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step4.test.js`
  - Tests: Verify correct path construction using task parameter, verify all file paths in prompt use folder() helper

- [X] **Test task-specific testing instructions in prompt**
  - Files: `src/steps/__tests__/step4.test.js`
  - Tests: Verify prompt warns against full test suite, verify prompt includes task-specific test examples, verify critical rules about no commits/git operations

## Verification
- [X] All tests pass
- [X] Code builds without errors
- [X] Coverage > 80% for step4.js
