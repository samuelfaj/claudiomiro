## OBJECTIVE
Create comprehensive unit tests for src/steps/step4.js module.
Done when: step4.test.js created, execution flow tested, finalization verified, tests pass, coverage > 80%.

## DEPENDENCIES
- Requires: TASK1, TASK2
- Provides for: NONE

## PARALLELIZATION
- Layer: 2 (Core Module Tests)
- Parallel with: TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16
- Complexity: Medium

## CONSTRAINTS
- Include tests with implementation
- TODO.md first line: "Fully implemented: NO"
- No manual/deployment steps
- Mock executeClaude function
- Test completion logic

## RISKS
1. Claude execution mocking → Mock executeClaude with resolved promises
2. File system operations → Mock all fs methods used
