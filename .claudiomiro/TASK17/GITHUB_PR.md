# Task 17: Unit Tests for step4.js

Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `src/steps/step4.js` with 32 test cases covering all aspects of the step4 execution logic including successful execution flow, failure handling with TODO.md refactoring, folder path construction, task-specific testing instructions, edge cases, and prompt content verification. All tests pass successfully with 100% code coverage (statements, branches, functions, and lines), exceeding the 80% coverage requirement.
