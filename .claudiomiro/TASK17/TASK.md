# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step4.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for step4 (testing and PR creation), including test execution, PR generation, and GITHUB_PR.md file creation.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK18, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step4.test.js (unit tests for step4.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Import and mock dependencies (fs, executeClaude, logger, state)
2. Test step4 function execution flow
3. Test test execution via Claude
4. Test PR description generation
5. Test GITHUB_PR.md file creation
6. Test git commit operations
7. Test state updates for PR creation
8. Verify error handling and edge cases

## Done When
- [ ] All step4 functions are tested
- [ ] Test execution is covered
- [ ] PR generation is mocked
- [ ] GITHUB_PR.md creation verified
- [ ] Git operations tested
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for step4.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/steps/step4.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for src/steps/step4.js
