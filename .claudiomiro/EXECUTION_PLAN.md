# Execution Plan

## Summary
- Total Tasks: 6
- Layers: 3
- Max Parallel: 4
- Parallelism Ratio: 2.0
- Criticality Level: HARD MODE

## Layers

### Layer 0: Foundation
- TASK1: Create parallel task state manager - NO DEPS
- TASK2: Create terminal UI renderer utility - NO DEPS
⚡ TASK1-2 run in PARALLEL

### Layer 1: Core Features (PARALLEL)
- TASK3: Integrate state tracking with DAG executor - Depends: TASK1
- TASK4: Enhance Claude executor for per-task message capture - Depends: TASK1
- TASK5: Build live UI rendering engine with progress - Depends: TASK2
- TASK6: Add progress calculation and total completion logic - Depends: TASK1
⚡ TASK3-6 run in PARALLEL (after their respective deps)

### Layer 2: Integration & Testing
- TASK7: Wire parallel logging into DAG executor main loop - Depends: TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6

## Dependency Graph

## Critical Path
TASK1 → TASK3 → TASK7 (3 steps)

## Reasoning Summary

**Parallelization Strategy:**
The task naturally splits into foundation (state + rendering), core features (4 independent enhancements), and final integration. Layer 0 has 2 fully independent tasks (state management vs terminal utilities - different concerns, different files). Layer 1 has 4 tasks that work on different aspects of the system once foundation is ready. This gives us 4 parallel tasks in the main execution layer.

**Why This Split:**
1. **TASK1 (State Manager)** - Tracks task status/steps/messages centrally. Multiple tasks depend on this shared state.
2. **TASK2 (Terminal Renderer)** - Pure utility for clearing/positioning cursor. No coupling with business logic.
3. **TASK3-6** - Each modifies different files/concerns:
   - TASK3: DAG executor initialization & status updates
   - TASK4: Claude executor message capture
   - TASK5: UI rendering logic with spinners/animations
   - TASK6: Progress calculation pure logic
4. **TASK7** - Final integration that wires the rendering loop into DAG executor

**Independence Verification:**
- TASK1 & TASK2: Different modules, zero overlap
- TASK3-6: Modify different parts of different files, can be developed simultaneously
- Only TASK7 needs all pieces working together

**Parallelism Opportunities:**
- Layer 0: 2 tasks in parallel
- Layer 1: 4 tasks in parallel (once deps met)
- Total: 6 parallel opportunities across 3 layers = 2.0 ratio
