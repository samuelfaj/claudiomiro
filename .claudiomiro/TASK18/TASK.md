# Task: Unit Tests for src/steps/step5.js

## Objective
Create comprehensive unit tests for step5 (final PR consolidation), including multi-task PR aggregation and git push logic.

## Dependencies
- **Depends on:** TASK1 (Jest setup)
- **Blocks:** TASK20 (Integration tests)
- **Parallel with:** TASK2, TASK3, TASK4, TASK5, TASK6, TASK7, TASK8, TASK9, TASK10, TASK11, TASK12, TASK13, TASK14, TASK15, TASK16, TASK17, TASK19

## Files Affected
**CREATE:**
- __tests__/steps/step5.test.js (unit tests for step5.js)

**MODIFY:**
- NONE

## Steps
1. Import and mock dependencies (fs, executeClaude, logger, state)
2. Test step5 function execution flow
3. Test GITHUB_PR.md aggregation from multiple tasks
4. Test final PR description generation
5. Test git push operation
6. Test PR creation via GitHub CLI
7. Test state updates for final PR
8. Verify error handling and edge cases

## Done When
- [ ] All step5 functions are tested
- [ ] PR aggregation is covered
- [ ] Final PR generation verified
- [ ] Git push tested
- [ ] GitHub CLI mocked
- [ ] Coverage > 90% for step5.js
- [ ] Tests run independently

## Verify
```bash
npm test __tests__/steps/step5.test.js
```
Expected: All tests pass with >90% coverage for src/steps/step5.js
