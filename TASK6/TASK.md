@dependencies [TASK4]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK4
- **Reasoning:** Requires TypeScript tooling to be installed before conversion
- **Assumptions:** All utility files exist in src/utils/ directory
- **Blocks:** None (can run in parallel with other independent conversions)
- **Parallel with:** TASK5, TASK7.1, TASK7.2, TASK7.3, TASK7.4, TASK8.1, TASK8.2, TASK8.3, TASK8.4
- **Risks:** Utility functions may have complex type requirements

# Task: Convert Utils Files to TypeScript

## Summary
Convert all utility files from JavaScript to TypeScript using static classes and proper type definitions.

## Complexity
Medium

## Dependencies
TASK4 (TypeScript and ESLint installed)

## Files to Convert
- src/utils/validation.js
- src/utils/progress-calculator.js
- src/utils/terminal-renderer.js

## Steps
1. Convert each utility file to TypeScript
2. Use static classes for utility functions
3. Add proper type definitions and interfaces
4. Ensure type safety and clean code practices
5. Add comprehensive tests for each utility

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] validation.js converted to validation.ts with TypeScript syntax
- [ ] progress-calculator.js converted to progress-calculator.ts
- [ ] terminal-renderer.js converted to terminal-renderer.ts
- [ ] Proper type definitions and interfaces added
- [ ] Static classes implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Type safety maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive tests added for each utility
- [ ] Code follows clean code principles

## Reasoning Trace
Utility files contain reusable functions that benefit greatly from TypeScript's type safety. Using static classes provides better organization and prevents namespace pollution.
