@dependencies [TASK4]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK4
- **Reasoning:** Requires TypeScript tooling to be installed before conversion
- **Assumptions:** src/config/state.js file exists and follows standard patterns
- **Blocks:** None (can run in parallel with other independent conversions)
- **Parallel with:** TASK6, TASK7.1, TASK7.2, TASK7.3, TASK7.4, TASK8.1, TASK8.2, TASK8.3, TASK8.4
- **Risks:** Complex state management logic may require careful type definitions

# Task: Convert Config Files to TypeScript

## Summary
Convert all configuration files from JavaScript to TypeScript using static classes and proper type definitions.

## Complexity
Medium

## Dependencies
TASK4 (TypeScript and ESLint installed)

## Files to Convert
- src/config/state.js

## Steps
1. Convert state.js to state.ts with TypeScript syntax
2. Use static classes where appropriate
3. Add proper type definitions and interfaces
4. Ensure type safety and clean code practices
5. Add comprehensive tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] state.js converted to state.ts with TypeScript syntax
- [ ] Proper type definitions and interfaces added
- [ ] Static classes implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Type safety maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive tests added
- [ ] Code follows clean code principles

## Reasoning Trace
Configuration files are foundational and should be converted first to establish the type system foundation. Using static classes provides better organization for configuration constants and utilities.
