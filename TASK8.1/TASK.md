@dependencies [TASK4]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK4
- **Reasoning:** Requires TypeScript tooling to be installed before conversion
- **Assumptions:** DAG executor, parallel state manager, and parallel UI renderer files exist
- **Blocks:** TASK8.5 (service index creation)
- **Parallel with:** TASK5, TASK6, TASK7.1, TASK7.2, TASK7.3, TASK7.4, TASK8.2, TASK8.3, TASK8.4
- **Risks:** Complex parallel execution logic may require sophisticated type definitions

# Subtask: Convert DAG Executor and Parallel State Management

## Summary
Convert DAG executor, parallel state manager, and parallel UI renderer from JavaScript to TypeScript using static classes and proper type definitions.

## Files to Convert
- src/services/dag-executor.js
- src/services/parallel-state-manager.js
- src/services/parallel-ui-renderer.js

## Interfaces / Contracts
- TaskStatus, TaskState, TaskConfig, DAGExecutorConfig, ParallelStateManagerInterface

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 3 files converted to TypeScript with proper extensions
- [ ] Proper type definitions and interfaces added
- [ ] Static classes implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Type safety maintained
- [ ] Comprehensive tests added for each service
- [ ] Code follows clean code principles
