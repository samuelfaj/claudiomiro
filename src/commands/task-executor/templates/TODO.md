## Context Reference

**For complete environment context, read these files in order:**
1. `.claudiomiro/AI_PROMPT.md` - Universal context (tech stack, architecture, conventions)
2. `TASK.md` - Task-level context (what this task is about)
3. `PROMPT.md` - Task-specific context (files to touch, patterns to follow)

**You MUST read these files before implementing to understand:**
- Tech stack and framework versions
- Project structure and architecture
- Coding conventions and patterns
- Related code examples with file:line references
- Integration points and dependencies

**DO NOT duplicate this context below - it's already in the files above.**

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] **Item X — [Consolidated action]**
- **What to do:** [detailed instructions of what to implement and how]
- **Context (read-only):** [files/dirs/docs to read]
- **Touched (will modify/create):** [files/modules]
- **Interfaces / Contracts:** [APIs/events/schemas/types]
- **Tests:** [type + key scenarios/edge cases]
- **Migrations / Data:** [DDL/backfill/ordering]
- **Observability:** [logs/metrics/traces/alerts]
- **Security & Permissions:** [authN/Z, PII, rate limits]
- **Performance:** [targets/limits/complexity]
- **Commands:** [local/CI commands to run]
- **Risks & Mitigations:** [risk → mitigation]

[...]

## Verification (global)
- [ ] Run local tests for changed code only
      Examples:
        npm test ./<changed-folder>
        npm test -- --testPathPattern="example"
        eslint --fix ./<changed-folder>
        tsc --noEmit ./<changed-folder>/index.ts
      -	CRITICAL: Do not run full-project checks here.
- [ ] Feature meets **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Frontend/back-end use the same routes, types, and schemas (if applicable).
