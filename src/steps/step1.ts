## Tasks to Analyze

${tasksDescription}

---

## Analysis Protocol

### Phase 1: Extract File Information
For each task, identify:
1. Files it will CREATE
2. Files it will MODIFY
3. Files/modules it depends on (logically)

### Phase 2: Detect Conflicts (PRECISE)

**File Write Conflicts (Sequential Required):**
- If Task A and Task B both MODIFY the same file → B depends on A
- If Task A CREATES file X and Task B MODIFIES file X → B depends on A

**NO Conflict (Parallel Allowed):**
- Task A creates file1.js, Task B creates file2.js → INDEPENDENT
- Task A modifies moduleA, Task B modifies moduleB → INDEPENDENT
- Task A and Task B both READ the same file → INDEPENDENT

### Phase 3: Detect Logical Dependencies

**True Logical Dependency:**
- Task B explicitly tests/uses Task A's output
- Task B extends/builds upon Task A's functionality
- Task B needs Task A's file to exist before it can work

**NOT a Dependency:**
- Tasks in the same domain (e.g., both about "users") → INDEPENDENT
- Tasks that sequentially make sense but don't share code → INDEPENDENT
- Task execution order preference (if not required) → INDEPENDENT

### Phase 4: Dependency Rules

1. **Default to Independence:** @dependencies []
2. **Add dependency ONLY if:**
   - Same file modified by both
   - Task B needs Task A's output to function
   - Clear build-upon relationship

3. **Chain Simplification:**
   - Only direct dependencies
   - If C→B→A, write: C: @dependencies [B], B: @dependencies [A]
   - NOT: C: @dependencies [A, B]

### Phase 5: Parallelization Strategy

**Prefer this pattern:**

    TASK1: @dependencies []  ← Foundation
    TASK2: @dependencies []  ← Independent feature 1
    TASK3: @dependencies []  ← Independent feature 2
    TASK4: @dependencies [TASK1, TASK2, TASK3]  ← Integration/tests

**Avoid this (over-coupling):**

    TASK1: @dependencies []
    TASK2: @dependencies [TASK1]  ← Why? If files are different, remove dependency
    TASK3: @dependencies [TASK2]  ← Chains should be justified

---

## Decision Process (Step by Step)

For each task:

1. **List files affected** (from "Files Affected" section)
2. **Compare with other tasks:**
   - Same file modified? → Add dependency
   - Different files? → Independent
3. **Check logical needs:**
   - Does it import/use another task's code? → Add dependency
   - Just related domain? → Independent
4. **Write @dependencies line**

---

## Output Format

For EACH task, **prepend** \`@dependencies [list]\` as the **FIRST LINE** of TASK.md:

**Example Decision Log:**

    TASK1: Creates src/server.js
    TASK2: Creates src/routes/health.js (imports from server.js)
    TASK3: Creates src/routes/users.js (imports from server.js)
    TASK4: Creates tests/health.test.js (tests TASK2's route)

    Analysis:
    - TASK1: Foundation, no deps → @dependencies []
    - TASK2: Needs server.js from TASK1 → @dependencies [TASK1]
    - TASK3: Needs server.js from TASK1 → @dependencies [TASK1]
    - TASK4: Tests TASK2's code → @dependencies [TASK2]

    Result: TASK2 and TASK3 run in parallel (both after TASK1)

**Applied to files:**

File: TASK1/TASK.md
    @dependencies []
    # Task: Initialize Express server
    ...

File: TASK2/TASK.md
    @dependencies [TASK1]
    # Task: Create health check endpoint
    ...

File: TASK3/TASK.md
    @dependencies [TASK1]
    # Task: Create users endpoint
    ...

File: TASK4/TASK.md
    @dependencies [TASK2]
    # Task: Add health endpoint tests
    ...

---

## Your Task

1. **Analyze** all ${tasks.length} tasks
2. **Extract** files affected from each task description
3. **Detect** file conflicts (same file = dependency)
4. **Identify** logical dependencies (uses output = dependency)
5. **Maximize** parallelism (default to @dependencies [])
6. **Update** ALL TASK.md files with @dependencies line

**Task names:** ${tasks.join(', ')}

**CRITICAL:**
- Update ALL ${tasks.length} task files
- @dependencies MUST be line 1
- Prefer parallelism over sequential
- Justify each dependency in your reasoning
- If in doubt about independence → tasks are INDEPENDENT

**Think:** What would allow multiple developers to work simultaneously?

## Tasks to Analyze

${tasksDescription}

---

## Analysis Protocol (HARD MODE)

### Phase 1: Extract File Information with Deep Analysis
For each task, identify and document:
1. Files it will CREATE (with justification for each)
2. Files it will MODIFY (specific sections/functions)
3. Files/modules it depends on (with analysis of why)
4. Assumptions made about the codebase structure

**Document your reasoning:** Why does this task affect these files? What assumptions are you making?

### Phase 2: Detect Conflicts (PRECISE & JUSTIFIED)

**File Write Conflicts (Sequential Required):**
- If Task A and Task B both MODIFY the same file → B depends on A
  - **Justification required:** Document WHY they can't both modify simultaneously
- If Task A CREATES file X and Task B MODIFIES file X → B depends on A
  - **Justification required:** Explain the dependency relationship

**NO Conflict (Parallel Allowed):**
- Task A creates file1.js, Task B creates file2.js → INDEPENDENT
- Task A modifies moduleA, Task B modifies moduleB → INDEPENDENT
- Task A and Task B both READ the same file → INDEPENDENT

**For each dependency decision, document:**
- What specific conflict exists?
- Why can't this be parallelized?
- What assumptions are being made?

### Phase 3: Detect Logical Dependencies with Reasoning

**True Logical Dependency:**
- Task B explicitly tests/uses Task A's output
  - **Document:** What specific output? How is it used?
- Task B extends/builds upon Task A's functionality
  - **Document:** What functionality? Why can't it be independent?
- Task B needs Task A's file to exist before it can work
  - **Document:** Why can't Task B create its own version?

**NOT a Dependency:**
- Tasks in the same domain (e.g., both about "users") → INDEPENDENT
- Tasks that sequentially make sense but don't share code → INDEPENDENT
- Task execution order preference (if not required) → INDEPENDENT

**For each non-dependency, document:**
- Why these tasks ARE independent
- What makes them parallelizable
- What assumptions support this conclusion

### Phase 4: Dependency Rules with Verification

1. **Default to Independence:** @dependencies []
   - Assumption: Tasks are independent unless proven otherwise

2. **Add dependency ONLY if:**
   - Same file modified by both (file conflict)
   - Task B needs Task A's output to function (logical dependency)
   - Clear build-upon relationship (documented)

3. **Chain Simplification:**
   - Only direct dependencies
   - If C→B→A, write: C: @dependencies [B], B: @dependencies [A]
   - NOT: C: @dependencies [A, B]

4. **Verification Checklist for each dependency:**
   - [ ] Specific file conflict identified?
   - [ ] Logical dependency clearly documented?
   - [ ] Assumption stated explicitly?
   - [ ] Alternative parallel approach considered and rejected?

### Phase 5: Parallelization Strategy with Reasoning

**Prefer this pattern (with justification):**

    TASK1: @dependencies []  ← Foundation (creates base infrastructure)
    TASK2: @dependencies []  ← Independent feature 1 (different files from TASK1)
    TASK3: @dependencies []  ← Independent feature 2 (different files from TASK1, TASK2)
    TASK4: @dependencies [TASK1, TASK2, TASK3]  ← Integration (tests all features together)

**Reasoning:** Why are TASK2 and TASK3 independent? What files do they each affect?

**Avoid this (over-coupling - justify if used):**

    TASK1: @dependencies []
    TASK2: @dependencies [TASK1]  ← Justify: Why does TASK2 depend on TASK1?
    TASK3: @dependencies [TASK2]  ← Justify: Why does TASK3 depend on TASK2?

### Phase 6: Deep Reasoning Documentation

For EACH task, you must add reasoning comments in TASK.md explaining:
1. **Why this dependency list?**
   - What specific conflicts or logical dependencies exist?
   - What assumptions support this analysis?

2. **What parallelization opportunities?**
   - Which tasks can run in parallel with this one?
   - Why are they independent?

3. **What risks exist?**
   - What could go wrong with this dependency analysis?
   - What edge cases were considered?

---

## Decision Process (Step by Step with Documentation)

For each task:

1. **List files affected** (from "Files Affected" section)
   - Document assumptions about file structure

2. **Compare with other tasks:**
   - Same file modified? → Add dependency + justify
   - Different files? → Independent + document why

3. **Check logical needs:**
   - Does it import/use another task's code? → Add dependency + explain what & why
   - Just related domain? → Independent + document reasoning

4. **Document assumptions:**
   - What are you assuming about the codebase?
   - What unknowns exist?

5. **Write @dependencies line + reasoning**

---

## Output Format

For EACH task, **prepend** \`@dependencies [list]\` as the **FIRST LINE** of TASK.md, followed by dependency reasoning:

**Example Decision Log with Deep Reasoning:**

    TASK1: Creates src/server.js (HTTP server base setup)
    TASK2: Creates src/routes/health.js (imports from server.js)
    TASK3: Creates src/routes/users.js (imports from server.js)
    TASK4: Creates tests/health.test.js (tests TASK2's route)

    Deep Analysis:
    - TASK1: Foundation, no deps → @dependencies []
      Reasoning: Creates base infrastructure that others will use
      Assumptions: Standard Express.js setup
      Risks: None, foundational task

    - TASK2: Needs server.js from TASK1 → @dependencies [TASK1]
      Reasoning: Imports app object from server.js to register route
      Assumptions: TASK1 exports configured Express app
      Risks: If TASK1 doesn't export app correctly, TASK2 will fail
      Parallel with: TASK3 (both register different routes)

    - TASK3: Needs server.js from TASK1 → @dependencies [TASK1]
      Reasoning: Imports app object from server.js to register route
      Assumptions: TASK1 exports configured Express app
      Risks: If TASK1 doesn't export app correctly, TASK3 will fail
      Parallel with: TASK2 (both register different routes)

    - TASK4: Tests TASK2's code → @dependencies [TASK2]
      Reasoning: Tests the health endpoint created by TASK2
      Assumptions: TASK2 implements /health endpoint correctly
      Risks: Test will fail if TASK2's endpoint doesn't exist
      Parallel with: TASK5 (if exists, testing different endpoint)

    Result: TASK2 and TASK3 run in parallel (both after TASK1)
    Parallelism Ratio: 4 tasks / 3 layers = 1.33
    Optimization opportunity: If TASK4 and TASK5 exist, they can run in parallel

**Applied to files with reasoning:**

File: TASK1/TASK.md
    @dependencies []

    <!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
    ## Dependency Analysis
    - **Dependencies:** None
    - **Reasoning:** Foundation task that creates base server infrastructure
    - **Assumptions:** Standard Express.js project structure
    - **Blocks:** TASK2, TASK3 (both need server.js)
    - **Parallel with:** None (must run first)
    - **Risks:** None identified

    # Task: Initialize Express server
    ...

File: TASK2/TASK.md
    @dependencies [TASK1]

    <!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
    ## Dependency Analysis
    - **Dependencies:** TASK1
    - **Reasoning:** Requires server.js (Express app) from TASK1 to register route
    - **Assumptions:** TASK1 exports configured app object
    - **Blocks:** TASK4 (health endpoint tests)
    - **Parallel with:** TASK3 (different route, no file conflicts)
    - **Risks:** Failure if TASK1 doesn't export app

    # Task: Create health check endpoint
    ...

File: TASK3/TASK.md
    @dependencies [TASK1]

    <!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
    ## Dependency Analysis
    - **Dependencies:** TASK1
    - **Reasoning:** Requires server.js (Express app) from TASK1 to register route
    - **Assumptions:** TASK1 exports configured app object
    - **Blocks:** TASK5 (users endpoint tests, if exists)
    - **Parallel with:** TASK2 (different route, no file conflicts)
    - **Risks:** Failure if TASK1 doesn't export app

    # Task: Create users endpoint
    ...

File: TASK4/TASK.md
    @dependencies [TASK2]

    <!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
    ## Dependency Analysis
    - **Dependencies:** TASK2
    - **Reasoning:** Tests the /health endpoint created by TASK2
    - **Assumptions:** TASK2 implements /health with correct status codes
    - **Blocks:** None (final layer)
    - **Parallel with:** TASK5 (if exists, tests different endpoint)
    - **Risks:** Test fails if TASK2's endpoint doesn't exist or behaves differently

    # Task: Add health endpoint tests
    ...
