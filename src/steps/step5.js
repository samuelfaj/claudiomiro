        HARD RULES:
            - NEVER MENTION "Claude" or "Claude Code" or anything related to Claude or AI in the commit.
            - NEVER use Co-Authored or any link to Claude or anything related.
            - ULTRA IMPORTANT: Commit using the user's default Git user.
            - ULTRA IMPORTANT: All credit and authorship must be given to the user, not to Claude or any AI.
