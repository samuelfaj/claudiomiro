## OBJECTIVE
Read the provided `{{claudiomiroFolder}}/AI_PROMPT.md` and **decompose it into a complete, lossless set of self-contained tasks** located under:

`{{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASK{number}/`

Each task must:
- Represent exactly one verifiable unit of work.
- Preserve the user‚Äôs intent **without merging, skipping, or paraphrasing away detail**.
- Be fully executable by an autonomous coding agent with no external clarification.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### üö® 1. NO INFORMATION LOSS
Every requirement, bullet, or implied behavior from `AI_PROMPT.md` must appear explicitly in **at least one TASK.md**.

- Each user requirement = at least one corresponding task or subtask.
- If a requirement touches multiple areas, split it carefully into parallel or sequential units.
- Missing or merged requirements = **automatic failure**.

You are not summarizing ‚Äî you are **preserving structure through decomposition**.

---

## üß† DEEP REASONING & METHODOLOGY

### 1. Recursive Breakdown
- Identify all top-level goals from `AI_PROMPT.md`.
- For each goal, ask:
  > ‚ÄúDoes this require reasoning, sequencing, or verification steps?‚Äù
   - If *yes*, expand into clear subtasks with their own reasoning context.
   - If *no*, keep it atomic ‚Äî one task, one verification.

Tasks should reflect **logical cohesion**, not arbitrary granularity.

---

### 2. Layer Analysis (Parallelization)
Identify execution layers to allow maximum parallelism without breaking dependency order.

- **Layer 0:** Foundation ‚Äî scaffolding, environment, initial config.
- **Layer 1+:** Parallelizable independent features or flows.
- **Layer N:** Integration, testing, or post-processing.
- **Final Œ©:** Cohesion Validation ‚Äî ensure the system is complete and correct as a whole.

Each task must clearly declare its layer and dependencies.

---

### 3. Automation-First Principle
Prefer **automated CLI or script-based actions** over manual edits.

‚úÖ Automated actions  
‚ÄÉe.g. `bunx prisma migrate dev`, `npm run build`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`

‚ùå Manual edits  
‚ÄÉe.g. editing generated code, copy-pasting build files

If manual edits are unavoidable:
- Document **why** automation is unsafe or impossible.
- Make them the exception, not the rule.

This ensures reproducibility and consistent automation pipelines.

---

### 4. Independence Logic
Tasks are **independent** if:
- They modify distinct files, modules, or flows.  
- Their outputs do not serve as inputs for one another.

Tasks are **dependent** if:
- One‚Äôs output is required for another‚Äôs input.
- One validates or extends another‚Äôs behavior.

Always express dependencies explicitly.

---

### 5. Complexity Evaluation
Before splitting a goal, assess its intrinsic complexity:

- **Low:** Simple config, setup, or trivial feature ‚Üí one task.
- **Medium:** One cohesive feature or API flow.
- **High:** Multi-flow system ‚Üí decompose into coherent parallel tasks plus a final integration.

Granularity should scale with complexity ‚Äî never too fragmented, never too broad.

---

### 6. Documentation Rules
Every `TASK.md` must be self-contained and readable in isolation:
- Explain what, why, and how.
- Document assumptions, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and reasoning.
- Include review and validation checklists.

Each task must make sense even if executed in parallel.

---

### 7. Final Assembly Validation
Always create a **Final Œ© Task** that:
- Depends on all others.
- Verifies all modules interact correctly.
- Ensures no requirement was forgotten.
- Confirms contracts, logs, tests, and flows align with system intent.

This is the **mandatory system-level validation** step.

üß© EXAMPLES (Simplified)

CRUD Flow:
	‚Ä¢	TASK1 ‚Äì Setup DB + routes (Layer 0)
	‚Ä¢	TASK2‚Äì5 ‚Äì CRUD endpoints (parallel, Layer 1)
	‚Ä¢	TASK6 ‚Äì Integration validation (Layer 2)
	‚Ä¢	TASK7 ‚Äì Final Œ© assembly verification

üö´ ANTI-PATTERNS

‚ùå Splitting trivial atomic operations.
‚ùå Forgetting the final validation layer.
‚ùå Treating parallel tasks as sequential without cause.
‚ùå Merging distinct requirements into a single task.

‚úÖ Decompose only when it increases clarity, autonomy, or testability.
‚úÖ Each task should represent a single verifiable truth from the user‚Äôs request.

## FINAL REQUIREMENT

Before finishing:
	‚Ä¢	Validate that every requirement from AI_PROMPT.md is covered by at least one task.
	‚Ä¢	Output all tasks as Markdown files inside {{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASK{number}/.
	‚Ä¢	Never summarize, merge, or skip any user-defined requirement.

## INPUT
{{claudiomiroFolder}}/AI_PROMPT.md

## OUTPUT
Multiple directories:
```
   {{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASK1/
   {{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASK2/
   ...
   {{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASKŒ©/
```
Each containing:
	- TASK.md
	- PROMPT.md

## PURPOSE
This process ensures 100% coverage of user intent, full reasoning traceability, and consistent modular execution by autonomous agents.
