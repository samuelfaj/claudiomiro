1 - Read the user prompt and **deeply understand the intent**.
   - Ask yourself:
      - What's the user's *real* goal?
      - Which parts are trivial vs complex?
      - What belongs to Layer 0 (foundation)?
      - What‚Äôs the critical path to success?
      - What can safely run in parallel?
      - What needs careful, sequential reasoning?
      - How will the final system prove internal consistency?

2 - **Context Expansion:**
   - Find and read all related files or modules.
   - Learn the system‚Äôs current architecture before decomposing anything.

3 - **Critical Refinement:**
   - Rewrite the user request with MAXIMUM CLARITY and detailed acceptance criteria.
   - Preserve intent, remove ambiguity, expose implicit requirements.

4 - **Selective Decomposition:**
   - Divide ONLY when it increases reasoning quality or parallelism.
   - Skip trivial, atomic tasks that any agent could complete in one shot.
   - Decompose *only complex or interdependent flows* (e.g., CRUDs, multi-layer features, cross-module integrations).

## üß† Deep Reasoning & Methodology

### 1. Recursive Breakdown (Selective)
- Start by listing all top-level goals.
- For each, ask: **‚ÄúDoes this task require sustained reasoning or multiple steps to verify correctness?‚Äù**
   - If *yes* ‚Üí expand it into self-contained subtasks.
   - If *no* ‚Üí keep it as a single execution unit.

### 2. Layer Analysis (Parallelization)
Identify natural execution layers:
- **Layer 0:** Environment, configuration, or scaffolding.
- **Layer 1+:** Independent features or flows that can run concurrently.
- **Layer N:** Integration, testing, documentation.
- **Final Œ©:** System Cohesion & Assembly Validation (mandatory).

### 3. Granularity Rules (Proportional)
  - Setup / structure
  - Core operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ‚Üí parallelizable
  - Integration test or final assembly

### 3.1. Automation-First Principle
- Always prefer **automated or command-based actions** instead of manual edits.
- Whenever possible, use commands, scripts, or CLIs to perform setup, installation, or configuration.
- Example:
   - ‚úÖ `npm i bootstrap` (automated)
   - ‚ùå manually editing HTML to add a Bootstrap CDN link
- Example:
   - ‚úÖ `npx prisma generate` or `bunx tsc --noEmit`
   - ‚ùå manually copying generated files
- Only perform manual edits when automation is **impossible** or **unsafe** to run automatically (e.g., private credentials, destructive DB operations).
- If manual edits are required, **document clearly why automation was not possible**.

This ensures consistency, reproducibility, and full automation across environments.

### 4. Independence Logic
Tasks are **independent** if:
‚úÖ Different files, modules, or layers  
‚úÖ Neither task depends on the other‚Äôs output

Tasks are **dependent** if:
‚ùå Output of one is explicitly needed as input for the next  
‚ùå One task verifies or extends the other

### 5. Complexity Evaluation
Before decomposing, classify each goal by complexity:
- **Low:** Setup, install, trivial refactor ‚Üí single task
- **Medium:** One cohesive feature (single flow)
- **High:** Multi-flow logic or interdependent systems ‚Üí split into sub-flows

### 6. Reasoned Documentation
Every `TASK.md` must be self-contained:
- What, why, how, assumptions, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and reasoning trace.

### 7. Final Assembly Validation
Always include a **final numeric task** to verify:
- All subtasks produce interoperable code
- No orphaned functionality
- The overall flow matches the intended architecture and logic

 üö® CRITICAL: All task files MUST be created inside the {{claudiomiroFolder}} directory, NEVER in the project root.
   - Create folders like: {{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASK1/, {{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASK2/, etc.
   - NEVER create TASK folders directly in the project root
   - ALL files must be inside the .claudiomiro subdirectory
   - TASK FOLDER NAMES MUST FOLLOW THE PATTERN: `TASK{number}`. E.g TASK1, TASK2, TASK3, ...

IMPORTANT: YOU MUST CREATE THE TASKS FILES:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Output Requirements

### A) `{{claudiomiroFolder}}/TASKX/TASK.md`
```markdown
@dependencies [Tasks]  // Task name MUST BE COMPLETE AND FOLLOW THE PATTERN "TASK{number}"
# Task: [Concise title]

## Summary
Explain clearly what must be done and why. Focus on reasoning and context.

## Complexity

## Dependencies
Depends on: [Tasks]  // Task name MUST BE COMPLETE AND FOLLOW THE PATTERN "TASK{number}"
Blocks: [Tasks] // Task name MUST BE COMPLETE AND FOLLOW THE PATTERN "TASK{number}"
Parallel with: [Tasks] // Task name MUST BE COMPLETE AND FOLLOW THE PATTERN "TASK{number}"

## Detailed Steps
1. [Detailed steps if needed]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clear, testable result #1
- [ ] ...

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Clear naming, no dead code.
- [ ] Errors handled consistently.
- [ ] ...

## Reasoning Trace
Explain design logic and trade-offs.

## CONSTRAINTS
- Prefer CLI or script-based actions over manual edits
- Automate everything possible (installation, configuration, generation)
- Manual edits only when automation is impossible ‚Äî must be justified
- Must include automated validation ONLY FOR CHANGED FILES (unit, smoke, or functional tests)
- Never include global tests or checks.
- No manual steps or external deployment needed
- Multi-repo / multi-directory support is fully supported (not a blocker)

## ‚úÖ Example: CRUD Flow (Selective Decomposition)

User request: `Implement CRUD for ‚ÄúStudents‚Äù`

Decomposition:

Layer 0
	‚Ä¢	TASK1 ‚Äî Setup database model + route structure (foundation)

Layer 1 (Parallel)
	‚Ä¢	TASK2 ‚Äî Create endpoint + validation + tests
	‚Ä¢	TASK3 ‚Äî Read/list endpoint + filters + tests
	‚Ä¢	TASK4 ‚Äî Update endpoint + tests
	‚Ä¢	TASK5 ‚Äî Delete endpoint + tests

Final Œ©
	‚Ä¢	TASK6 ‚Äî System Wiring & Contract Validation (depends on all)
      - Confirm that all components communicate correctly end-to-end ‚Äî routes are exposed, payload contracts are respected, validation works, persistence behaves consistently, and (if applicable) the UI interacts with the correct APIs.
      - Validate request/response contracts for each endpoint: payload shape, status codes, and error structure.
      - Check that shared resources (env vars, migrations, seeds, middlewares, permissions) are properly wired.
      - Verify log and telemetry health: no silent errors, expected messages appear in the flow.
      - if repository allows it can make integration tests otherwise perform smoke checks or scripted validations to confirm system wiring.

‚Üí Bootstrap install, linter config, etc. = atomic, no decomposition.

## ‚úÖ Example: Multi-step Form Flow (Selective Decomposition)

User request: `Implement a 3-step signup form with validation, autosave, and final submission`

Decomposition:

Layer 0
‚Ä¢ TASK1 ‚Äî Setup form framework + base layout (foundation)

Layer 1 (Parallel)
‚Ä¢ TASK2 ‚Äî Step 1 (User Info) form logic + validation
‚Ä¢ TASK3 ‚Äî Step 2 (Address Info) form logic + validation
‚Ä¢ TASK4 ‚Äî Step 3 (Review & Confirm) summary page + submission logic

Layer 2
‚Ä¢ TASK5 ‚Äî Autosave system + localStorage sync (depends on all form steps)
‚Ä¢ TASK6 ‚Äî System Wiring & Contract Validation (ensure navigation, autosave, and final submission interact correctly)

Final Œ©
‚Ä¢ TASK7 ‚Äî System Cohesion & Assembly Validation (depends on all)
	‚Ä¢	Review UI consistency, accessibility, and overall user flow
	‚Ä¢	Verify the final submission persists data correctly and clears cache

‚Üí CSS tweaks, icon imports, and component styling = atomic (no decomposition).

üö® Anti-patterns

‚ùå Splitting trivial tasks (installing libs, editing configs)
‚ùå Creating tasks smaller than the reasoning they require
‚ùå Omitting the final assembly check
‚ùå Treating parallel tasks as sequential when unnecessary

‚úÖ Decompose only when it increases clarity, autonomy, or verifiability.
‚úÖ Keep simple things simple, and hard things distributed but coherent.

üö® CRITICAL: TASK FOLDER NAMES MUST FOLLOW THE PATTERN: `TASK{number}`. E.g TASK0, TASK2, TASK3, ...
