@dependencies [TASK4]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK4
- **Reasoning:** Requires TypeScript tooling to be installed before conversion
- **Assumptions:** step2.js file exists and follows standard patterns
- **Blocks:** TASK7.5, TASK7.6 (integration tasks)
- **Parallel with:** TASK5, TASK6, TASK7.1, TASK7.2, TASK7.4, TASK8.1, TASK8.2, TASK8.3, TASK8.4
- **Risks:** Step execution flow may have complex state management requirements

# Task: Convert step2.js to TypeScript

## Summary
Convert step2.js to TypeScript using static class pattern and proper type definitions.

## Scope
- Convert src/steps/step2.js to src/steps/step2.ts
- Implement Step2 static class with execute method
- Add comprehensive type definitions and interfaces
- Convert test file to TypeScript
- Ensure type safety and clean code practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] step2.js converted to step2.ts with proper extension
- [ ] Step2 static class implemented with execute method
- [ ] Proper type definitions for task parameter
- [ ] Interface for step execution flow
- [ ] Import types from dependencies
- [ ] step2.test.js converted to step2.test.ts
- [ ] Unit tests for static class methods
- [ ] Type safety tests for task parameter validation
- [ ] Step execution flow tests
- [ ] Integration tests with sub-steps
- [ ] Code follows clean code principles
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
