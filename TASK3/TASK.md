@dependencies [TASK2]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK2
- **Reasoning:** Should list files AFTER test removal to get accurate source file inventory for migration planning
- **Assumptions:** Standard src/ directory structure exists
- **Blocks:** TASK4 (TypeScript setup needs accurate file inventory)
- **Parallel with:** TASK1
- **Risks:** None identified - read-only file listing operation

# Task: List All Source Files

## Summary
Create a comprehensive inventory of all existing files in the src directory to plan the TypeScript migration.

## Complexity
Low

## Dependencies
TASK2 (Tests removed)

## Steps
1. List all files in src directory and subdirectories
2. Document file structure for migration planning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete list of all files in src directory
- [ ] File structure documented

## Reasoning Trace
Understanding the current codebase structure is essential for planning the migration and ensuring no files are missed during conversion.
