@dependencies [TASK9]

<!-- DEPENDENCY REASONING -->
## Dependency Analysis
- **Dependencies:** TASK9
- **Reasoning:** Should document the complete TypeScript migration after all conversion tasks are completed
- **Assumptions:** All TypeScript conversion tasks have been successfully completed
- **Blocks:** None (final documentation task)
- **Parallel with:** None (should run after all other tasks)
- **Risks:** Documentation may need updates if conversion tasks reveal unexpected issues
